# PathHack
I often need to use external applications in command line 
and tired of "'some-app' is not recognized as an internal or external command".
Adding applications to PATH environment variable is tedious(ish) task in windows.
Solution: 
1. We add one folder to PATH.
2.Put PathHack.exe in it. 
Now we can make any app callable from command line by running command "PathHack .\app-path-to-add.exe"
